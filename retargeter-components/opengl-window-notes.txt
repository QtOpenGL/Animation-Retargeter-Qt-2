OpenGLWindow Notes-

Use OpenGLWindow::setAnimating(true) for render() to be called at the vertical refresh rate, assuming vertical sync is enabled in the underlying OpenGL drivers.

This is a slot so it can be connected to a QTimer::timeout() signal to perform animation. Note however that in the modern OpenGL world it is a much better choice to rely on synchronization to the vertical refresh rate of the display


Use QElapsedTimer instead of manually calculating time intervals. Why re-invent the wheel.


V-sync is hard ;) -> lets not go for vertical refresh at the moment
