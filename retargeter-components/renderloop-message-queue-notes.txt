Render and Message Loop Notes
-----------------------------

QOpenGLWindow animation may just work with:

1. a QMainWindow application and QOpenGLWindow child. Link the slots and signals. OpenGlWindow has its own loop
2. a QWindow parent with buttons and QOpenGLWindow child. Link the slots and signals. OpenGLWindow has its own loop
3. a QMainWindow application and QOpenGlWidget child. Create a render loop on QMainWindow.
